            <h2>God is My Safe Place</h2>
            <p>
                When I'm overwhelmed, I go silent - but i whisper to God. I know he hears.
                He understands what I don't even how to say. He holds the weight I hide from others.

            <h2>A Different Kind of Passion</h2>
            <p>
                Most kids my age don't care much about God's Word. It's not popular to open a Bible or talk about Jesus.
                But I feel drawn to Him. I want to know Him deeply - not because I have to, but because I need Him and
                He loves me.
                Even when I struggle or drift, something in me always come back to Him.
