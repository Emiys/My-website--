            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Elizabeth - a Nigerian girl with a good heart, a sharp mindðŸ˜‰, a tech enthusiast, a singer, dancer,
                a girl with deep thoughtsðŸ˜… and dreams bigger than I can explain.
                I'm learning how to be strong and soft at the same time, It's not easy. ðŸ˜ª
                I'm trying to be everything everyone needs while still figuring out who I am. Being a Black in a mostly
                white community makes me feel like i stand out in ways I didn't ask to. I feel like I have to work twice
                as hard to be understood.

            <h2>Why I made This</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes I feel a lot and don't know how to say it out loud. So I mad this space.
                It's like my heart has its own website now.

            <h2>Things I Struggle With</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My emotions â€” sometimes I snap, but not out of meanness. I just feel unheard, unhealed, and heavy
                    inside.
                </li>
                <li>I'm shy and quiet â€” it's hard to speak up even when I want to.</li>
                <li>I get good grades, but I still feel like it's never enough to be truly appreciated at home.</li>
                <li>I get corrected a lot for how I express myself â€” like hissing or complaining â€” even when I'm just
                    overwhelmed.</li>
                <li>My parents expect a lot from me. As a Nigerian girl, I'm taught to respect and do more â€” sometimes
                    it's a
                    heavy pressure.</li>
                <li>There's someone I really like,also feels the same way but with the
                    pressure I'm under. It's confusing.</li>
                <li>I feel different, like people around me don't always see how deep my thoughts go.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>But I'm Still Standing</h2>
            <p>
                Despite all this, I'm growing. I'm learning to let my faith guide me and my dreams lift me. I want to be
                seen
                not just for my quietness, but for my strength.
