            <h3>🌌 My Safe Space</h3>
            <p>This is where I leave my deepest thoughts, prayers, and tears — just between me and God.</p>

            <h3>🫣 How I Really Feel But Will Deny in Public:</h3>
            <p>
                Not gonna lie… I’ve been in my feelings lately 🥲
                Not because anyone did anything wrong, but because I care. Maybe too much. Maybe loudly.
                <br><br>
                I overthink like it's my full-time job. When someone I care about goes quiet, my brain just loads:
                <br>💭 “Did I annoy them?”
                <br>💭 “Am I too much?”
                <br>💭 “Are they talking to someone else who’s funnier or cooler or just… not me?”
            </p>

            <p>
                I know he’s the kind of person that doesn’t talk a lot. Someone close to him even said texting him is
                kinda dry — and now I get it. That’s just how he is. And honestly? That’s okay.
                <br><br>
                I don’t want him to change who he is. I just wish we still had those chill conversations, our Bitmoji
                twinsies (😭 why did he change his outfit tho), the basketball jokes, the random voice notes.
                <br><br>
                I’m not even tryna date right now. I just want a strong friendship — the kind where we both feel seen,
                heard, and safe. You know? Like… real connection.
            </p>

            <h3>💔 My Deepest Secret:</h3>
            <p>
                Uhm… okay so… this one’s hard to type.
                <br><br>
                I’m really afraid of losing people.
                I feel alone in this world a lot, even when I’m surrounded by people. Like I’m not enough. Like no
                matter how much I try, I’ll always fall short.
                <br><br>
                I cry a lot. Not for attention. Just quietly. In my room. Hugging a pillow. Telling God things I can't
                even say out loud.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes I feel like people are gonna leave… or forget me… or just stop caring.
            </p>

            <h3>🍁 Moving to Canada & Missing Home:</h3>
            <p>
                Canada is cool. But also… weird. I miss home more than I ever thought I would.
                I miss my old friends, the vibe, the laughter, the way we understood each other without needing to
                explain our slang or tone.
                <br><br>
                I miss shouting “UP NEPA!!!” 😭
                <br>
                I miss being surrounded by people who just… got me.
                <br><br>
                Here, I feel like I’m always trying to “adjust.” Like my accent makes people pause. Like I have to
                translate myself — my jokes, my feelings, my whole vibe — just to fit in. And honestly? It’s exhausting.
            </p>

            <h3>🪐 Space Mode Activated:</h3>
            <p>
                So yeah… I think I need to float in space again. No gravity. No pressure. Just me, God, and whatever
                healing sounds like these days.
                <br><br>
                I’m not mad at anyone. I’m just tired of wondering if I’m too much or not enough.
                I’m learning to pour love back into me. 🌸
                <br><br>
                Goodnight from me, my overthinking brain, and one dramatic tear gliding down my face like in a
                telenovela 😭
                <br>Catch y’all on the moon. Or maybe Mars.
            </p>
