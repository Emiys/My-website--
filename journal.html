            <h2>Unspoken</h2>
            <p>
                There are days I snap, not because I'm mean, but because something deep inside me feels unheard,
                unhealed, and heavy.
                Anger isn't always loud violence. Sometimes it's silent sadness that got tired of being patient.

            <h2>Learning to Let Go</h2>
            <p>
                Some days I feel like I'm holding in too much — like if I let it out, I'd fall apart.
                But letting go doesn't always mean losing. Sometimes it's the bravest way to win.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not perfect. I feel deeply. I care loudly. And that's okayyy.

            <h2>When Love Feels One-Sided</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes, we give our hearts to someone who doesn't know how to carry them.
                We wait for a message, a call, a sign... and it doesn't come. It makes us wonder if we're too much — but
                the
                truth is, maybe we were just asking the wrong person to see us clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm learning that love isn't supposed to feel like begging. That I don't have to shrink myself to fit
                into
                someone else's "busy." Real love shows up, even in small ways. And if it doesn't? That's a loud answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                So now I'm pouring back into me — into my growth, my faith, my passions. Because one day, someone will
                meet me
                where I am — and not just when it's convenient.

            <h2>📝 Emotionally Available but Emotionally Confused 😂💔</h2>
            <p>
            <h3>
                <p>July 7, 2025</p>
            </h3>
            Sometimes I feel like I'm emotionally available... but also emotionally confused 😭
            It's like I want to be there for others, but I also need to figure out my own feelings first.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think I’ve been doing too much.
                Like… *tooooo much*.
                I just want simple vibes, close friendships, and a consistent “wyd” that doesn’t end with “I’m watching
                a movie.” 😤😭
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s crazy how I’ll be having a serious moment, trying to talk things out in my head like:
                “Should I call him or give him space?”
                …then boom… my brain starts singing childhood theme songs:
            </p>
            <p>
                ✨🎵 “I was a girl in the village doing all rightttt…” 🎵✨
            </p>
            <p>MA’AM. THIS IS A CRISIS. WHY ARE YOU SINGING <mark>SOFIA THE FIRST⁉️</mark> 💀</p>

            <p>
                I'm trying to balance everything — faith, friends, family, feelings, school (even though I'm on vacay
                rn), and lowkey my own brain is not helping 💀
            </p>
            <p>
                If overthinking was a job? I’d be CEO, CFO, HR, and the intern.
                I just want real friendships — where we talk things out, vibe, and I don’t have to guess if I’m annoying
                or you don't like talking to me
