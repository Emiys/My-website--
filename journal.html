            <p>
                There are day I snap, not because I'm mean, but because something deep inside me feels unheard,
                unhealed, and heavy.
                Anger isn't always loud violence. Sometimes it's silent sadness that got tired of being patient.

            <h2>Learning to let Go</h2>
            <p>
                Some days I feel like I'm holding in too much - like if I let it out, I'd fall apart.
                But letting go doesn't always mean losing. Sometimesit's bravest way to win.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not perfect. I feel deeply. I care loudly. And that's okayyy.

        <h2>When Love Feels One-Sided</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes, we give our hearts to someone who doesn't know how to carry them.
            We wait for a message, a call, a sign... and it doesn't come. It makes us wonder if we're too much - but the
            truth is, maybe we were just asking the wrong person to see us clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm learning that love isn't supposed to feel like begging . That I don't have to shrink myself to fit into
            someone else's "busy." Real love shows up, even in small ways. And if it doesn't? That's a loud answer
        </p>
        <p>
            So now I'm pouring back into me. Into my growth, my faith, my passions. Be one day, someone will meet me
            where I am - and not just when it's convenient.
